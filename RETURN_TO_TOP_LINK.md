# [Return To Top Link]

## Description

This PR suggests the addition of a 'Return To Top' link added to the bottom of the content pages. This addition would allow for improvement in user experience/convenient site navigation. 

One simple implementation of this PR would include:
- Adding ```<a name="top"></a>``` at the top of the page
- Adding ```<a href="#top">Return to Top of Page</a>``` (or however you would like to word it) in the footer or after the page's content, however it is structured.
