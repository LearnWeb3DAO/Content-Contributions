# [Link To Quiz]

## Description

This PR suggests the addition of a 'Take The Quiz!' link added to the bottom of the content pages. This addition would allow for improvement in user experience/convenient site navigation. The user can simply click the link to navigate to the quiz, rather than scrolling to the top (or using 'Return to Top' link which is proposed in my other PR), going to the dashboard, and selecting the right quiz.

A simple implementation of this, using the 'What is Gas?' article as an example, would include:
- Adding ```<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSey4xTsqX5bXvsZt5nFhHULRGiZovES7krmXaDNuu7P_tgZfg/viewform" target="_blank">Take The Quiz!</a>``` after the article. (Along with the predetermined styling, of course)
